# An overview for Apple Beta Program, Microsoft's Insider Program alternative:
# Apple releases OSes software every year which complies software as a service , shorthand SaaS, basis. Before the software released officially, they have alpha and beta versions before comes the release that is official for production.
# So, for Apple, they have 3 Apple Seed Programs for choices to us. The Seeds are:
# Regular
# PublicSeed
# DeveloperSeed

# You will recieve the builds with first priority If user select 2 seed programs instead of "Regular", means the builds numbers higher than regular builds usually for production.

# We will explain the 3 Apple Seed Programs and how they works.

# Regular, aka Regular Seed:
# This is default seed when Apple devices once manufactured. And it must use this seed for daily production purposes. This seed also used for GitHub Actions by default.

# PublicSeed, aka Public Beta Seed:
# This is the beta seed which used for up to 75% of users if users have an Apple ID and registered the Apple Public Beta Program.
# Apple users once registered this program, you will recieve beta builds but have no developer tools and only for general testing purpose before rolled out officially. And this is only seed to public for free of charge.

# DeveloperSeed, aka Developer Seed Offical:
# This is beta seed for developers which allows downloading most current versions of macOS packages.
# Users must apply an developer account with Apple ID and pay USD$99 annually before downloading this seed program's beta builds.
# User with Apple Developer ID, once downloaded and installed these of builds, you will only recieve developer community support by Apple.

# This creation script is default to Developer Seed while generating installation disk.
